Project Summary
This is an e-commerce website called "Touski√©" built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The site features:

Responsive design with mobile navigation
Multiple pages: home, shop, product details, blog, about, contact, and cart
Product showcases with images, descriptions, and prices
Interactive elements like image galleries in product pages
Newsletter signup and contact forms
Footer with contact information, social media links, and app download options
The design uses a consistent color scheme and layout across pages, with responsive navigation that collapses to a mobile menu on smaller screens. The site appears to be a fashion retailer focusing on clothing items like sweaters, jackets, and accessories.
